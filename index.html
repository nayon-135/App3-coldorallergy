        var allergy_count = 0;//this is the code for establishing the variable of allergy, and the one below is for cold.//
        var cold_count = 0;//This code if for establishing the variable of cold.//
//The below functions are to be able to count the number of answers that contribute to allergy or cold.//

        function allergyAdd(){
	    allergy_count = allergy_count + 1;
        }

        function coldAdd(){
            cold_count = cold_count + 1;
        }
	
	function result(){
		var allergyPercent = (allergy_count/4)*100;//this is for calculating percent allergy by dividng by the four total questions, and multiplying this by 100.//
		var coldPercent = (cold_count/4)*100;//this is for calulating percent cold, using the same method above//
		var result = document.getElementById("five");//this is so that it replaces the results test final page with the resulting pprobablities.//
		result.innerHTML = "Probability it is allergies =" + allergyPercent + "<br> Probability it is a cold =" + coldPercent;
	}
	//I inserted this line above to showcase the percent allergy and the percent chance of cold.//
	//At first, I had the code above below the other codes for creating the other pages, but that didn't work. So, I moved it here.//
	//It still didn't work, so I tried changed the ID page to five instead of "results" and also adjusted the spacings.//
	//I just moved this entire code on the top above the script; after I moved it, I also adujusted my spacing of the var allergy percent, and it finally produced the results page and the percentages I needed.//
//After all of this, I realized I needed to make sure my ID references on the results page matched the page ID before it//
